## Yield Farming Tutorial

Yield farming is the concept of incentivizing users with passive income in exchange for providing liquidity. The first step in yield farming involves adding funds to a liquidity pool, which are essentially smart contracts that contain funds. These pools provide liquidity to a marketplace where users can exchange, borrow, or lend tokens. Once you’ve added your funds to a pool, you’ve officially become a liquidity provider. In return for staking your finds in the pool, you’ll be rewarded with fees generated from the underlying DeFi platform. Reward tokens themselves can also be deposited in liquidity pools, and it’s common practice for people to shift their funds between different protocols to chase higher yields.

### Environment and Dependencies Setup

Open up your code editor (I'm using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)) and create a new directory for this project.
```
mkdir hw-farm
```

Install [Node js](https://nodejs.org/en/) if you do not have it.

In the project directory, install the [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/) module:
```
npm i --save-dev hardhat
```

Open up Hardhat with `npx hardhat`.
